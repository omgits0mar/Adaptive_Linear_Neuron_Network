## Usage

To use the Adaline neural network implementation and the GUI, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `python GUI.py` to launch the GUI

## Acknowledgements

The implementation of the Adaline neural network algorithm is based on the work of Bernard Widrow and Ted Hoff, and the GUI is built using the tkinter library.
